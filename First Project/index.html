        <strong>Early life and passions (1955 – 1970)</strong> - Gates was born
        on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. His father was an attorney;
        his parents pushed him to pursue a career in law. However, Gates loved
        electronics and wrote his first software program at the age of 13 that
        allowed a user to play tic-tac-toe against the computer. Looks like
        electronics beat law. As curious young boys, Gates and Paul Allen, the
        other future founder of Microsoft, were banned from the PDP-10 computer
        system because they were caught using exploits in the system for
        additional free computer time. Gates loved the idea of discovering
        unknown exploits and formed a programmers club to make money and gain
        additional computer time by offering his services to the Computer Center
        Corporation. He was 15 years old when The Computer Center Corporation
        went out of business.

        <strong>Young adulthood and early career (1971 – 1974) </strong> - Gates
        co-founded Traf-O-Data in 1972 with Paul Allen and Paul Gilbert; they
        used an Intel processor to make traffic counters. He was 17 years old.
        After Traf-O-Data, he spent a short time as a congressional page in the
        House of Representatives. A year later, he posted an impressive
        Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) score of 1590 (out of 1600). This score
        helped him gain admission into Harvard College. At the request of his
        parents, he initially pursued a pre-law major but he combined it with
        computer science classes. In 1974 while still a student at Harvard, he
        joined Paul Allen at Honeywell but quickly saw an opportunity to
        introduce their own company based on computer software a year later.

        <strong>
          Dropping out of Harvard and starting Microsoft (1975 – 1979)
        </strong>
        - Before completing his studies at Harvard, Gates wanted to focus his
        attention on starting his own company with Allen. In 1975, he dropped
        out of Harvard with support from his parents. Later that year, Allen and
        Gates started working with Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems
        (MITS) to distribute software. Due to the duo’s compatibility, Allen
        came up with the name “Micro-Soft” to describe their partnership. The
        name came from combining the term “microcomputer” and “software.” In
        1976, they registered “Microsoft” in New Mexico, and Gates permanently
        gave up on his Harvard studies. Microsoft cut ties with MITS in 1976 and
        continued to evolve in the computer programming and software world. In
        1979, they moved Microsoft from New Mexico to Washington state.

        <strong>Creating partnerships with big brands (1980 – 1985)</strong> -
        In 1980, Microsoft partnered with IBM to develop an operating software
        for a newly developed personal computer. This was their first
        significant software sale and it netted them $50,000 for the rights to
        the software. It was also the beginning of MS-DOS software. In 1983,
        Allen became ill with Hodgkin lymphoma, which ended the formal
        partnership leaving Gates at the helm of Microsoft. Gates and Microsoft
        introduced the first version of the now infamous Microsoft Windows in
        1985. He later produced Windows 95, 98, 2000, XP, Vista, and 10.

        - Gates began dating Melinda Gates, formerly Melinda French, in 1987
        after meeting at a Microsoft event. They got married in 1994 and the
        couple now has three children in their early 20s. The Gates main
        residence is in Medina, Washington. When Gates was 31 he became the
        world’s youngest billionaire. Microsoft and IBM became subject to a
        Federal Trade Commission investigation in 1990 for possible collusion to
        split the operating system market to avoid competition. However, even
        with ongoing investigations, Microsoft continued to excel, as did
        Gates’s wealth. In 1995, Gates was worth approximately $12.9 billion and
        was named the world’s richest man.
